# choice-extension

Browse guilt-free.

Too many sites have content that has been posted without the consent of the parties involved. This extension aims to make ethical pornography a legitimate choice for users, while also giving the victims of this terrible situation a chance to regain their privacy.

## How It Works

Users who want to be more responsible about their watching habits can download our chrome extension and then continue to browse as they normally would.

When the user comes across a video that might be unethical in some way, they can then right-click anywhere on the page and be redirected to a page where they can report the video and give their reason for doing so.

If while browsing, our extension detects a video that has been reported to our database, then a popup will block the video and clicking on it will take the user to a page where the user can see why the video has been reported. After this the user gets to decide, whether the report is justified or not. If they feel it isn't justified, then the user has the freedom to watch the video as the only role of our product is to inform the user and let them make their own decisions.
